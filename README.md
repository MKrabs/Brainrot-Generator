**Features:**

* Auto-magically generates cinematic videos with blurred backgrounds (because your eyes deserve it)
* Smartly centers your visuals without any annoying cropping drama
* Adds text like a boss, so your message *really* hits home
* Slaps on overlays and audio to make your vids sing (literally)

Built for those who don’t have time to fiddle, but still want to flex with slick vids. Perfect for content creators, marketers, or anyone who’s ever stared too long at a background image and thought, “This needs more blur.”

Just drop your assets in a folder, run `./make_video.sh your_folder/`, and boom — cinematic gold.
